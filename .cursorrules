# Atoro AI Shield Code Standards

## URL Structure Standards
- All service URLs must follow the pattern: /services/cyber-security/[service-name]
- Use kebab-case for URLs (e.g., iso-27001, not iso27001)

## Component Architecture
- Use functional components with explicit TypeScript interfaces
- Follow consistent naming: Service pages should use PascalCase (e.g., Iso27001Service)
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable UI elements into shared components

## Performance Requirements
- Optimize all images with responsive sizing and lazy loading
- Implement code splitting for all route components
- Only render content when needed (use lazy loading for below-fold content)
- Use memoization for list components

## Security Standards
- No development/test pages in production builds
- Sanitize all HTML content with DOMPurify before rendering
- Implement proper Content Security Policy
- No hardcoded credentials, even placeholders

## SEO & Accessibility
- All images must have descriptive alt text
- Use semantic HTML elements instead of generic divs
- Implement proper ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Each page must have standardized metadata
