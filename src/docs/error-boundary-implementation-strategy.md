# Error Boundary Implementation Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for implementing error boundaries throughout the Atoro AI Shield application to ensure proper error handling, improve user experience, and facilitate debugging.

## Error Boundary Component Types

We have created three types of error boundary components:

1. **Basic ErrorBoundary**: Simple component that catches errors and displays a fallback UI.
2. **EnhancedErrorBoundary**: Advanced component with retry functionality, detailed error information, and customizable error tracking.
3. **DataLoadingErrorBoundary**: Specialized component for data loading operations with specific messaging and UI.

## Implementation Levels

Error boundaries should be implemented at the following levels:

### Level 1: Application Root
- Implemented in `src/App.tsx` to catch catastrophic application errors
- Provides a full-page error UI with minimal navigation options
- Logs errors to our error tracking service in production

### Level 2: Layout Components
- Implemented in `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx` and similar layout components
- Preserves navigation elements (header, footer) when content errors occur
- Provides a scoped error UI that doesn't disrupt the entire application experience

### Level 3: Page Components
- Implemented in each page component (e.g., `src/pages/Iso27001Service.tsx`)
- Uses `EnhancedErrorBoundary` to provide retry functionality
- Reports errors with page-specific context for better debugging

### Level 4: Critical UI Sections
- Implemented around critical UI sections like forms, interactive elements, and data-heavy components
- Uses specialized error boundaries based on the component type
- Provides contextual error UIs that match the component's purpose

### Level 5: Data Fetching Components
- Implemented around components that fetch or display dynamic data
- Uses `DataLoadingErrorBoundary` with appropriate resource naming
- Offers retry functionality specific to data loading scenarios

## Implementation Priority

Implement error boundaries in the following order of priority:

1. **High Priority**
   - Application root (`App.tsx`)
   - Main layout components
   - Service pages (which represent core business offerings)
   - Form submissions and payment flows

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Blog and content pages
   - Interactive UI components (carousels, tabs, etc.)
   - Navigation components
   - Search functionality

3. **Lower Priority**
   - Static content components
   - Decorative UI elements
   - Development and test pages

## Error Reporting

All error boundaries should use the centralized error reporting utility:

```typescript
import { handleBoundaryError } from '@/utils/errorReporting';

// Usage in error boundaries
<ErrorBoundary 
  onError={(error, errorInfo) => 
    handleBoundaryError(error, errorInfo, 'ComponentName')
  }
>
  {children}
</ErrorBoundary>
```

In production, errors should be sent to an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry) with:
- Component information
- User context (if available)
- Route information
- Error stack traces

## Custom Fallback UIs

Create appropriate fallback UIs for different contexts:

1. **Catastrophic Failures**: Full-page error UI with minimal home navigation
2. **Page Failures**: Section-specific error UI with refresh option
3. **Component Failures**: Inline error message appropriate to the component size
4. **Data Loading Failures**: Data-specific error with retry button

## Testing Error Boundaries

Test error boundaries by:

1. Creating test components that intentionally throw errors
2. Verifying that error boundaries catch errors and display the correct fallback UI
3. Ensuring that error reporting functions are called with the correct parameters
4. Testing retry functionality where applicable

## Implementation Checklist

For each component where error boundaries are implemented:

- [ ] Determine the appropriate error boundary type
- [ ] Create a contextual fallback UI
- [ ] Implement proper error tracking
- [ ] Add retry functionality where appropriate
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Document any component-specific error handling

## Error Boundary Maintenance

- Review error reports regularly to identify common failure points
- Update error boundaries as component requirements change
- Refine fallback UIs based on user feedback and interaction data
- Keep error reporting utilities updated with the latest best practices

## Getting Started

Start by implementing error boundaries in these high-priority components:

1. `src/App.tsx` (Root level)
2. `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx` (Layout level)
3. `src/pages/*Service.tsx` (Service page level)
4. `src/components/shared/*` (Shared component level)

For each implementation, use the appropriate error boundary component and customize the fallback UI to match the component's context and purpose.
