      question: "How long does the ISO 27001 certification process typically take?",
      answer: "While ISO 27001 certification typically takes 6-12 months for most organizations, our streamlined approach can help you achieve certification in as little as 12 weeks. This accelerated timeline is possible because of our pre-built policy templates, implementation expertise, and dedicated support throughout the process."
    },
    {
      question: "Is ISO 27001 certification mandatory for SaaS companies?",
      answer: "ISO 27001 certification is not legally mandatory for most SaaS companies, but it is increasingly becoming a business requirement. Many enterprise clients now require their vendors to have ISO 27001 certification before signing contracts, making it essential for SaaS companies looking to grow their enterprise customer base."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does ISO 27001 implementation typically cost?",
      answer: "The cost of ISO 27001 implementation varies depending on your organization's size, complexity, and existing security controls. Our service provides a predictable, fixed-fee approach with transparent pricing. We offer different packages starting from $25,000, and we'd be happy to provide a detailed quote during our initial consultation."
    },
    {
      question: "What resources will we need to dedicate internally?",
      answer: "Our approach minimizes the burden on your internal team. You'll need to assign a project sponsor (typically a CTO or CISO) and allocate approximately 5-10 hours per week from relevant team members. We handle the heavy lifting of documentation, control implementation guidance, and audit preparation."
    },
    {
      question: "How does ISO 27001 compare to SOC 2?",
      answer: "ISO 27001 is an international standard focusing on information security management systems, while SOC 2 is a US-based framework focused on service organizations' controls. ISO 27001 is more prescriptive and globally recognized, while SOC 2 is more flexible. Many organizations pursue both certifications, and our implementation approach can support a combined effort."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after we achieve certification?",
      answer: "ISO 27001 certification requires ongoing maintenance and annual surveillance audits. Our service includes 12 months of post-certification support to help you maintain compliance, address any new requirements, and prepare for surveillance audits. We also offer extended maintenance packages for organizations seeking longer-term support."
