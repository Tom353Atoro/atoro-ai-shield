   - Mention real-world threat models relevant to SaaS companies

   - Use rhetorical questions that address client pain points
   - Include transitional phrases a human expert would use
   - Vary sentence structure and length for natural rhythm

## Anti-AI Detection Techniques

- Avoid perfect symmetry in paragraph structures

- Use analogies and metaphors specific to tech/security

## For Each Page, Focus On:

1. **Hero Section**: Craft a compelling, specific promise that addresses the primary pain point
2. **Overview**: Explain the service in technical but accessible terms using industry-specific language
3. **Benefits**: Transform generic advantages into concrete, measurable business outcomes
4. **Process/Approach**: Detail your methodology with enough specifics to demonstrate expertise
5. **Social Proof**: Make testimonial sections sound authentically human
6. **CTA**: Create urgency based on business impact, not generic calls to action

Remember: The goal is to sound like a seasoned cybersecurity professional speaking to a tech-savvy business leader, not a marketing department or an AI.
